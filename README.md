##Project Description
By analyzing the data of past transactions and current local listings, we seek to provide suggestions to someone looking to buy a property in NYC on whether the price offered is reasonable and whether it would the price go higher or lower in the future.

We will primarily train our model on a dataset of the annualized properties sales from the year 2003 to 2015, provided by New York City Department of Finance. This dataset covers 13 years of properties sales data for all 5 boroughs of New York as well as descriptive information on those sold properties.
